# Versioned native runtime SDK

This is a minimal fork of upstream tag `0.1.154`. `llama-cpp-2`'s safe API and
the native source-build flags are unchanged. `llama-cpp-sys-2/build.rs` gains
automatic prebuilt SDK selection and an explicit offline external mode.
Git consumers do not fetch a llama.cpp submodule. Only a selected source build
resolves native source, pinned separately in `build_support/source-lock.json`.
No crates.io packages are published.

## Baseline and supported configurations

Baseline: `zvec-ai/zvec-grep`, branch `codex/cuda-static-linking`, commit
`cc8fa72938db42b648687fccd99b088e94520186`.
Native source: llama.cpp `5f55650a78f92aff4d48d671423e888fac0469ff`.
Bundle release: `zvec-0.1.154-r1`. Native ABI/configuration changes require a new
bundle revision; bootstrap-only changes can reuse this pinned native SDK.

| Rust target | Native linkage | sys features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aarch64-apple-darwin | static, CPU/Metal | common, metal |
| x86_64-apple-darwin | static, upstream Apple backends | common |
| aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu | static, CPU | common |
| x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | shared core + CPU variants + CUDA plugins | common, cuda, dynamic-link, dynamic-backends |
| x86_64-pc-windows-msvc | shared core + CPU variants + CUDA plugins | common, cuda, dynamic-link, dynamic-backends |
| x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | static, CPU-only | common |
| x86_64-pc-windows-msvc | static, CPU-only | common |

Only the two x64 targets gain an additional CPU-only archive (seven SDKs total).
They use `zvec-0.1.154-cpu-r1` and `build_support/cpu-runtime-lock.json`; existing
archives and CUDA loading/fallback logic are unchanged. Exact features and native
options select the archive before any download, using the existing verified cache.
The CPU lock pins the published Linux/Windows archives after real builds,
external-consumer linkage and CPU inference passed in
[run 39413216584](https://github.com/zvec-ai/llama-cpp-rs/actions/runs/39413216584).
Matching x64 `{common}` builds use only the CPU archive in `auto` and `prebuilt`;
they never download a CUDA archive instead. The same run also verified the
Windows source-build C1083/header-path fix included in `5abf435`.

`common` is intentional: upstream's safe crate still enables the sys crate's
default features even when its own defaults are disabled, exactly as in zg.
Apple backend defaults, including embedded Metal shaders and Accelerate, are
left to the pinned upstream build. Intel macOS sets deployment target 14.0,
matching zg. OpenMP is disabled. Release native builds are used for both debug
and release Rust consumers. Linux GNU builds use Ubuntu 24.04; do not claim an
older glibc baseline. MSVC uses the dynamic CRT.

CUDA 13.1.1 primary architectures:
`75-real;80-real;86-real;89-real;90-real;90-virtual`.
CUDA 12.4.1 fallback architectures:
`50-virtual;61-virtual;70-virtual;75-virtual;80-virtual;86-real`.
The fallback is **only** `lib/cuda12/ggml-cuda.dll` or
`lib/cuda12/libggml-cuda.so`, never a second core library. NCCL is disabled.
NVIDIA driver/runtime libraries are supplied by the deployment environment.

## Consumer contract

Pin the fork Git commit in the consuming repository. Archive/manifest digests
and native configuration are embedded in the sys crate's
`build_support/runtime-lock.json` (plus `cpu-runtime-lock.json` for x64 CPU);
consumers do not maintain a second lock file
or build wrapper. Do not track a moving branch or fetch a remote checksums file
as the source of trust on every build.

Ordinary `cargo build` and `cargo test` default to `LLAMA_CPP_BUILD_MODE=auto`:

- Matching target, resolved sys features and native configuration download once
  and reuse the SHA-256-pinned Release SDK, including generated bindings.
- Native options that differ from the SDK select upstream's normal source
  build and print the reason. Examples include a different CUDA architecture
  list, enabling Vulkan/OpenMP, `GGML_CPU_REPACK=OFF`, `CXXFLAGS`, a lower macOS
  deployment target, or `-C target-cpu=native`.
- Normal Rust application changes, Rust debug/release profiles, logging and
  `-C debuginfo=1` reuse the same Release native SDK. To request native Debug,
  set `LLAMA_LIB_PROFILE=Debug` explicitly.
- `LLAMA_CPP_BUILD_MODE=prebuilt` requires a match; `source` always compiles
  from source. Unsupported targets/features use source mode in `auto`.
- Download/integrity failures are errors, not silent source fallbacks.

Source builds fingerprint native options and reconfigure CMake when they
change. Successful configuration is recorded only after the native build
completes, so failed attempts cannot reuse a partial cache as a valid one.

The cache defaults to `$CARGO_HOME/llama-cpp-runtimes` (normally
`~/.cargo/llama-cpp-runtimes`). `LLAMA_CPP_RUNTIME_CACHE` overrides its root.
SDKs are locked during atomic population and reverified when selected.
`LLAMA_CPP_RUNTIME_ARCHIVE=/path/to/pinned.tar.gz` can populate a cold cache
without network access, with the same digest checks. Curl is needed only for a
cold network download, not for an already-cached SDK.

For offline builds set `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true` or `LLAMA_CPP_OFFLINE=1`; a cache
miss then fails unless a local archive is supplied. Cargo's `--offline` flag
alone is not exposed to dependency build scripts and cannot control their
downloads. Existing explicit `external` mode below remains strictly offline.

### On-demand native source

The fork has no `.gitmodules` entry or gitlink for llama.cpp, so Cargo's Git
dependency acquisition does not download native source before `build.rs` runs.
`prebuilt`, matching `auto`, and `external` never resolve source, even on a
cold Cargo Git cache. A failed SDK download/checksum remains an error and does
not trigger source acquisition.

Only `source` or a real native-option mismatch in `auto` reaches the source
resolver. It verifies the exact revision above using both a pinned GitHub
codeload archive SHA-256 and a deterministic full file-tree SHA-256. It never
checks out a branch, initializes a submodule, changes an existing Git checkout,
or updates global Git configuration.

Source-only controls (ignored when an SDK is selected):

- `LLAMA_CPP_SOURCE_DIR`: use an existing byte-identical pinned source tree,
  read-only, without needing curl or Git. Root `.git` metadata is ignored, but
  modified/extra source files, symlinks and converted line endings are rejected.
- `LLAMA_CPP_SOURCE_CACHE`: content-addressed cache root, defaulting to
  `$CARGO_HOME/llama-cpp-sources` (normally `~/.cargo/llama-cpp-sources`). Warm
  entries are reverified; concurrent cold fetches are locked and installed
  atomically. Corrupt entries or injected Git metadata are errors, not silently
  replaced. Directory membership and all pinned files participate in Cargo's
  freshness checks, including newly added files and vendor headers.
- `LLAMA_CPP_SOURCE_ARCHIVE`: populate a cold source cache from the exact pinned
  `.tar.gz`, with the same archive and extracted-tree checks, without network.

With no explicit source directory, a warm cache is preferred. An existing
legacy `llama-cpp-sys-2/llama.cpp` checkout is also reusable if clean and exactly
pinned; this ignored directory is preserved, not managed by Cargo. An explicit
source archive bypasses a legacy checkout, so it can be used without modifying
dirty local source. Otherwise the source archive is downloaded once, only when
a source build is needed.
Source archives are not bundled into the sys crate's package.

`LLAMA_CPP_OFFLINE=1` or `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true` prohibits both SDK and source
downloads. Existing verified caches, source directories or supplied archives
still work. A cold source miss reports the required revision and ways to seed
it offline. Cargo's `--offline` alone does not govern build-script networking.
Source builds still require the platform's bindgen/CMake/C++/CUDA toolchain.
`DEP_LLAMA_SOURCE_DIR` and `DEP_LLAMA_SOURCE_REVISION` identify the actual source
chosen by the sys build script. Changing its resolved location reconfigures
CMake rather than reusing a cache tied to the previous source path.

For fully manual external mode, fetch once (Python 3.12+ and curl), then build:

```sh
python native/fetch.py --target aarch64-apple-darwin \
  --sha256 <pinned-archive-sha256> --output /absolute/path/to/runtime
export LLAMA_CPP_BUILD_MODE=external
export LLAMA_CPP_RUNTIME_DIR=/absolute/path/to/runtime
export LLAMA_CPP_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_SHA256=<pinned-manifest-sha256>
cargo build --locked
```

The safe crate dependency must use `default-features = false`; enable `cuda`
and `dynamic-backends` together on the two CUDA targets. Unsupported feature
combinations, wrong target/version, source-build overrides, missing files,
extra files, symlinks and hash failures are rejected in explicit external mode.
That mode never downloads or falls back to source. Do not set the runtime
directory when selecting automatic or source mode.

Each archive contains per-target pre-generated `bindings.rs`, a `manifest.json`,
native link/runtime libraries under `lib/`, and licenses. Generated bindings
are produced alongside the matching binary by the maintainer, **not** by the
consumer. The sys crate still has its upstream Rust build dependencies; external
mode does not execute bindgen, CMake, a C++ compilation or nvcc. A normal Rust
linker, target SDK and platform C++ runtime remain necessary (including the Apple
compiler-runtime search path on macOS).

The manifest records the native feature set, emitted link libraries, relevant
CMake cache entries, compiler information, source revision and payload SHA256s.
`DEP_LLAMA_RUNTIME_DIR` / `DEP_LLAMA_RUNTIME_MANIFEST` are available to direct
sys dependents. The existing `DEP_LLAMA_BACKENDS_DIR` contract is preserved.

For distribution, copy required shared libraries/plugins to the application's
runtime layout, configure executable loader paths, and call the existing
`load_backends_from_path` with the relocated directory. The SDK includes linker
archives/import libraries as well as runtime files; it is **not** an end-user
application package. Avoid shipping the entire SDK when only runtime files are
needed. Linux plugins use `$ORIGIN`, with `$ORIGIN/..` for the fallback. Windows
consumers must arrange DLL search paths before process startup (or use zg's
existing delay-load setup). This step does not change zg's loader or packaging.

## Build and release

`native-release.yml` runs only via `workflow_dispatch`; select `prebuilt/0.1.154`
when publishing. Ordinary pushes do not rebuild or republish native SDKs.
Its default variant retains the original five-platform and CUDA gates. Select
`variant=cpu` to build only the two CPU-only SDKs on ordinary hosted runners,
without CUDA toolchain setup or GPU jobs, reusing the same packaging, external
consumer, real CPU inference and audit steps. This defaults to preparing metadata;
publication additionally requires `publish_cpu=true`. No existing release is
overwritten. Review and import the resulting `cpu-runtime-lock.json` into the sys
crate only after actual native acceptance; consumers never trust a live remote index.
Locally, `runtime.py primary --target <x64-target> --variant cpu` builds one CPU
SDK, and `publish.py --assets <merged-assets> --variant cpu --prepare-only`
generates its pins without GitHub calls. These are maintainer tools, not ZG wrappers.
All five native builds and real CPU inference tests run on ordinary hosted
runners. **Only** the Linux x64 and Windows x64 runtime verification jobs use `gpu-runners`, labels
`gpu-linux-t4` and `gpu-windows-t4`. They download the already-built SDK and Rust
probe; they do not rebuild native code.

The primary build invokes the upstream Cargo build script, then harvests the
exact OUT_DIR reported by Cargo (no guessed paths or latest-artifact selection).
The fallback uses the same pinned CMake options/toolchains as zg. CMake cache
assertions catch configuration drift. The release archive is then re-extracted
at another path and used to compile the probe in external mode with intentionally
invalid libclang/C++/CUDA tool paths. Rust contract tests cover rejection cases.

Every platform runs a real checksum-pinned EmbeddingGemma 300M Q8 embedding and
checks dimension/finiteness. Linux also runs without NVIDIA libraries installed.
GPU tests exercise CUDA 12-only and CUDA 13 environments, assert actual layer
offload and the loaded plugin path, and compare CPU/GPU embeddings (cosine
similarity >= 0.999). Native dependency audits and inference logs are retained
as Actions artifacts. A published pre-release means all gates passed; it does
not claim every CUDA architecture was executed (hardware verification is T4).

The default release job publishes all five SDKs, per-target manifests, `SHA256SUMS` and
`runtime-lock.json`. Existing releases/assets are never overwritten. Upstream
crate publishing and automated update workflows are guarded to upstream's repo
and disabled in this fork. `main`, imported tags and published SDKs are not
modified. This branch removes the submodule registration while retaining the
same native revision/ABI. zg integration is a separate acceptance-gated step.

Local entry points: `python native/runtime.py --help`, `python native/e2e.py
--help`; unit tests: `python -m unittest discover -s native -p 'test_*.py' -v`.

An opt-in macOS ARM64 verification uses a disposable Git snapshot and a genuinely
empty Cargo Home (not a path dependency). It guards native Git/source downloads,
CMake and bindgen, tests SDK failures without source fallback, then performs an
on-demand source build, offline reuse, real CPU/Metal inference and cache-tamper
checks. It never commits the working branch, pushes, publishes or dispatches CI:

```sh
python native/verify_lazy_source.py \
  --sdk-archive /absolute/path/to/pinned-macos-sdk.tar.gz \
  --model /absolute/path/to/embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0.gguf
```

Pass `--source-archive /absolute/path/to/pinned-source.tar.gz` to avoid the source
network download in this opt-in test. Logs/report stay under `target/lazy-source-*`.
Other platform/backend execution must be verified separately.
